🎱 EightballPoolArena
📖 About the Game
Eightball Pool Arena is an interactive, web-based 8-ball pool game that allows players to enjoy a realistic billiards experience. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this game simulates the classic 8-ball pool gameplay, featuring cue physics, ball collisions, and turn-based mechanics.

🎮 How to Play
Objective: The goal is to pocket all your assigned balls (solids or stripes) and then pocket the 8-ball to win.
Game Start:
The game begins with a break shot.
Players are randomly assigned either solids (1-7) or stripes (9-15) after the first successful shot.
Taking Turns:
Players take turns aiming and shooting the cue ball to hit their assigned balls.
If a player pockets one of their balls, they get another turn.
If they miss, the turn switches to the opponent.
Fouls:
Pocketing the cue ball (scratch) allows the opponent to place it anywhere on the table.
Hitting the wrong type of ball first results in a foul.
If the 8-ball is pocketed before all assigned balls, the player loses instantly.
Winning the Game:
The first player to pocket all their balls and legally sink the 8-ball wins!

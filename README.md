## 🎮 How to Play
### Objective
Pocket all your assigned balls—either **solids (1-7)** or **stripes (9-15)**—and then legally sink the **8-ball** to claim victory!

### Game Start
- The game kicks off with a **break shot**.
- After the first ball is pocketed, players are assigned either solids or stripes based on the type of ball sunk.

### Taking Turns
- Players aim and shoot the **cue ball** to pocket their assigned balls.
- Pocket a ball successfully, and you earn another turn.
- Miss or foul, and it’s your opponent’s go.

### Fouls
- **Scratch**: Pocketing the cue ball lets your opponent place it anywhere on the table.
- **Wrong Hit**: Striking the opponent’s ball first or failing to hit your own counts as a foul.
- **Early 8-Ball**: Pocketing the 8-ball before clearing your assigned balls results in an instant loss.

### Winning the Game
- Be the first to pocket all your balls and sink the 8-ball legally to win!
